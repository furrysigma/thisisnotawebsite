# Archive patcher

This exists so that after [thisisnotawebsitedotcom.com](thisisnotawebsitedotcom.com) is shut down or changed drastically, it can still be accessed and used.<br>
All of the assets come from the [archive](https://github.com/furrysigma/archive). It does not work offline.

## Where is it?

You can find it [here](https://furrysigma.github.io/thisisnotawebsite)!!

## Known Issues:
 - The bottle on the left does not properly pop up. I cannot figure this one out for the life of me.
 - Fonts are using fallbacks (not a huge issue).

All assets belong to the website's original owners.
